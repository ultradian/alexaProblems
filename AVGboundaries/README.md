# AVG boundaries
This is a problem I found by playing with APL in the Authoring Tool - the TV preset gives the wrong `viewport.pixelHeight` and `viewport.pixelWidth`

You can demonstrate this by uploading the [TVnumbers.json](TVnumbers.json) file into the Authoring tool, and clicking on the different presets.
