# subscribeBreak
**Problem**: if you have mp3 playing using audioplayer, you have to exit your skill. So, if the user says anything like "help", or "subscribe me to your podcast", it is interpreted as 1st party Amazon response and goes to Amazon's 'help' or tries to subscribe you to Amazon music.

I'm thinking of the best way to demonstrate this inside the skill as well since you have to hand off to Amazon for ISP, too.  There isn't really a good solution to this problem.
